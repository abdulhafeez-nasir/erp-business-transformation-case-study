ERP Implementation Case Study – VastraCraft Innovations
Overview

This repository presents a structured case study examining the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system at VastraCraft Innovations, a fast-growing online fashion brand that blends traditional craftsmanship with modern e-commerce operations. The project demonstrates applied skills in business analysis, operational transformation, and ERP strategy, with a focus on enabling scalable growth while preserving artisanal production processes.

Business Challenge

Rapid business growth exposed significant limitations in VastraCraft’s legacy systems. Manual workflows and fragmented data resulted in frequent order fulfillment errors, shipping delays, and poor inventory visibility—particularly challenging given the company’s reliance on limited handcrafted materials. These issues led to rising customer complaints and threatened service reliability and brand reputation.

Solution & Impact

An integrated ERP solution was evaluated and implemented to streamline operations, improve data accuracy, and establish a scalable operational foundation. Within the first year following implementation, the initiative delivered measurable improvements:

30% reduction in order fulfillment errors

25% decrease in shipping delays

15% increase in customer satisfaction scores

The ERP system also significantly improved inventory visibility and planning for handcrafted materials, enabling better coordination across operations, IT, and artisan teams.
